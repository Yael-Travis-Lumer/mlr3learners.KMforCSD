Description: This package implements kernel machine regression based on a modification
    of the quadratic loss, as described in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00991}{Kernel Machines for Current Starus Data}.
    This package is a wrapper of the KMforCSD package that enables CV for hyper-parameter tuning, and is based on the MLR3 template.
